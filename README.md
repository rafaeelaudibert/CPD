# Data Search and Classification Class Reports

This repo contains reports for the Data Search and Classification (INF01124) subject, at [INF](https://inf.ufrgs.br)-[UFRGS](https://ufrgs.br).

### Configuring
To run the web server which this "website" uses, you will need:

* [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) >= 9.4.0
* NPM >= 5.6.0

By installing nodeJS, NPM (Node Package Manager) should be automatically installed.

### Running
For the first time you are running the server, you must run `npm install`.

In the next times, the only needed command is `npm start`, and after that you can already have access to the app at `localhost:5000`.

You can choose the report you want to access in the initial page.

### Live Version
This reports have also been adapted to a series of blog posts, released on my [personal blog](https://inf.ufrgs.br/~rbaudibert/blog), with its integral content.
